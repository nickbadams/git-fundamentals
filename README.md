A starting point for discovering the wonderful world of Git, GitHub, and Git Annex (Assistant)

## TODO

1. What is Git?
  - Click "Help" at the top of any GitHub page
  - GitHub recommends the official Git installer
  - I recommend:
       - [homebrew](http://brew.sh) for OS X
       - [gitbash](http://msysgit.github.io/)
       - Your package manager for Unix, etc.
2. What is GitHub?
  - It's a web app
  - There's also a desktop app
  - And even a mobile app!
3. Fix our LICENSE

A. If there's time: what is Git Annex (Assistant)?

Nick: I like the one where Bart acts up and annoys Homer.
